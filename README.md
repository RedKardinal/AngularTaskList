# AngularTodolist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20. This is my first attempt to create a "Task List" using Angular (TypeScript). I used Angular Documentation (found at Angular's Website, <a href="https://angular.io/docs">Click Here</a>) and YouTube videos for help. The Task list was built using a JSON placeholder to hold the tasks using a REST API. This is found at this link, <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">Click Here.</a> I have run `ng build` on this repository.
